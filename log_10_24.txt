In this meeting we made sure all team members were clear on which libraries, management systems, and environments we are using on the project.
React JavaScript library for the front-end.
Node.js for the middle layer.
PostgreSQL for the back-end.
AWS as host.
We discussed the requirements for Project Milestone 3 and decided on the database as one of the demo features.
The other demo feature/features are to be decided.
