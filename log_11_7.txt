In this meeting, we discussed the requirements for project milestone 4. 
We worked on each requirement based on which part of the project each of us is responsible for. 
We revised our list of features, listed our completed features, issues faced during development, and TA suggestions.
We created a Draw.io for our architecture diagram.
We created a wireframe for our front end design.
We created a ERD model for our database design.
We did not create any model for web service design since we don't plan on using any APIs.
We added all requirements to a Project Milestone 4 document.
We pushed our Project Milestone 4 document to our github repository, and submitted it's link on canvas.
