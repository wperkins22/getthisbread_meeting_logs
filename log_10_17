In this meeting, we began finalizing the project plan and assigning people to tasks and roles on the trello board we created. 
We just about completed finalizing the last of the milestone 2 pdf, which integrates everything we did last time, the user stories,
the features list, and the project plan.

The basic home page was assigned to Hudson to begin as a staging point for our team, who will be supported by In Ji as needed.
